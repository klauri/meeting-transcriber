SPEAKER_02: [0:00:00.250000->0:00:03.946000]  Mary Jane was the only victim to be murdered indoors.

[0:00:04.908000->0:00:12.569000]  In her room in Miller's court, the Ripper had the time and space to realise his very darkest fantasies.
[0:00:13.447000->0:00:16.906000]  When detectives discover the body, they send around a photographer.
[0:00:17.345000->0:00:21.429000]  we get the first and only photographs of a Ripper crime scene.
[0:00:22.188000->0:00:23.420000]  They're truly chilling.
[0:00:24.753000->0:00:28.955000]  but they're also a powerful in vesticuary tool that we can deploy today.
[0:00:29.731000->0:00:35.772000]  by using the scene of crime photographs and the really detailed notes taken by detectives who were there.
[0:00:36.143000->0:00:42.690000]  we can recreate the murder scene in detail. For the first time in over 130 years.
[0:00:44.041000->0:00:47.568000]  We've built a full-scale replica of Mary James bedroom.
[0:00:47.770000->0:00:51.094000]  to help understand the Ripper's psychology.
[0:00:58.975000->0:00:59.583000]  I agree.
[0:01:00.038000->0:01:03.548000]  Peter is once again helping us investigate the murder scene.
SPEAKER_01: [0:01:04.291000->0:01:07.362000]  So tell me, what was Minnesota's call a flat house?

SPEAKER_02: [0:01:07.362000->0:01:17.487000]  No, it was a ground floor room in a block of over a dozen flats and we have a photograph of the outside of the building here, taking on the day that Mary Jane Kelly was murdered.

SPEAKER_00: [0:01:17.977000->0:01:18.061000]  Oh.

SPEAKER_01: [0:01:18.061000->0:01:19.023000]  America.

SPEAKER_00: [0:01:19.023000->0:01:20.930000]  Jane Kelly, what do we know about her?

SPEAKER_02: [0:01:20.845000->0:01:23.005000]  Well, she was about 25 years old.

SPEAKER_00: [0:01:23.123000->0:01:26.481000]  And so she's the youngest of the Ripper victims.

[0:01:26.549000->0:01:29.215000]  What were her movements on the day of her murder?
SPEAKER_01: [0:01:29.215000->0:01:29.266000]  you

SPEAKER_02: [0:01:29.620000->0:01:37.264000]  Well, we know that at about 2am she goes out and she's seen with a man and that's the last sighting we have of Mary Jane Kelly alive.

SPEAKER_00: [0:01:37.265000->0:01:54.545000]  And remember this is the height of the Jack the Ripper murders. There's a heightened police presence. The newspapers are going crazy about covering the Jack the Ripper case. And there are wanted posters all around Whitechapel saying, beware, Jack the Ripper, and he's still prepared to kill.

SPEAKER_02: [0:01:56.013000->0:02:11.741000]  This is an exact reproduction of Mary Jane Kelly's room built to scale and the furniture is placed exactly as it was found by the police when they came through the door after Mary Jane Kelly's death. So what is it exactly that you would look for when you first come into a crime scene?

SPEAKER_01: [0:02:11.740000->0:02:39.871000]  In a modern day investigation detectives would be looking for traces of DNA, fingerprints, shoemarks or even tiny microscopic fibres that could have been transferred from the clothing of the victim to the killer or vice versa. But of course in 1888 none of this exists so they would have been completely reliant upon the visual signs. What was the crying scene telling them? Was there any sign of forced entry?

SPEAKER_02: [0:02:39.922000->0:02:46.301000]  no sign of forced entry and in fact the police had to bring an axe to break down the door so

[0:02:46.739000->0:02:49.473000]  Presumably the Ripper was invited in.
SPEAKER_00: [0:02:49.726000->0:02:56.358000]  and there's absolutely no sense of this at first glance being a murder scene, is there?

SPEAKER_02: [0:02:56.257000->0:03:03.665000]  No, and that's strange. I mean, I sort of expect that there would be clothes strewn across the floor and the furniture would be upturned, but in fact...

[0:03:04.103000->0:03:09.992000]  The clothes were found perfectly folded and Mary Jane Kelly's boots by the fireplace.
SPEAKER_01: [0:03:10.381000->0:03:13.705000]  She was clearly comfortable in the company of this man.

SPEAKER_02: [0:03:14.127000->0:03:17.013000]  So what does that say about the Ripper himself?

SPEAKER_00: [0:03:17.401000->0:03:36.234000]  Well, it tells us that Jack the Ripper, at least initially, was a very plausible punter. He could put the women at ease. But then, of course, in relation to Mary Jane Kelly, this is the first crime he's committed inside a woman's room. And frankly, he's in no hurry to leave.

SPEAKER_02: [0:03:36.875000->0:03:41.127000]  Dr. Thomas Bond attended the murder scene and made detailed notes.

[0:03:41.549000->0:03:44.451000]  which we are using in our reconstruction.
SPEAKER_01: [0:03:45.245000->0:03:49.194000]  But if we follow his report and say that the heavy blood stain...

[0:03:49.379000->0:04:02.018000]  was there and of course the pool of blood was found underneath it indicates that her body's been moved somewhat from the point at where I would contend she was murdered to this side of the mattress.
SPEAKER_02: [0:04:01.748000->0:04:02.811000]  And why would that be?

SPEAKER_00: [0:04:02.018000->0:04:02.035000]  Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: [0:04:02.035000->0:04:02.052000]  Yeah.

SPEAKER_00: [0:04:02.052000->0:04:02.069000]  Yeah.

SPEAKER_01: [0:04:03.183000->0:04:03.200000]  you

SPEAKER_00: [0:04:03.200000->0:04:10.946000]  pulling the victim away avoids him being covered in blood and allows him to pose Mary Jane Kelly.
